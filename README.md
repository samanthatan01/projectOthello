### About The Game

<p>
<li> Number of players required: 2
<li> 8x8 square board with black and white discs
<li> Each player has a color - either black or white
<li> The aim of the game is to get more discs of your color on the board than the opponent
<li> At the start of the game, 2 black discs and 2 discs will be placed in the middle of the 8x8 board
<li> The player 1 (black disc) will make the first move to start capturing player 2’s (white disc) piece by surrounding the white disc(s) with a black disc either horizontally, vertically or diagonally
<li> If the move is valid, player 2’s white disc(s) will be captured i.e flipped over to black, increasing the number of black discs on the number
<li>The game ends when the board is full, both players choose to 'PASS' or when one player forfeits
<li> The winner is determined by the most number of discs on the board when the game ends
